# Romanesco Soil data files

Part of [Romanesco](https://romanesco.info).

These files contain a Gitify extract of Romanesco. In other words: they are the
physical representation of a fully functional Romanesco installation.

This repository needs to be cloned in a subfolder called _romanesco inside a
Romanesco Soil project. The installer (Romanesco Seed) will take care of this.
